Technical Implementation:
Use Soldexer's Pipes for easy setup of data streams
Combine multiple data sources (DEX swaps, NFT metadata, pump.fun tokens)
Real-time WebSocket updates to frontend
Clean, modern UI with data visualizations
Why This Works for a Hackathon:
âœ… Achievable in 1 day: Uses pre-built Soldexer pipes
âœ… Showcases speed: Demonstrates ~2-3s latency vs traditional solutions
âœ… Multiple data types: Shows Soldexer's versatility
âœ… Real user value: Traders/investors would actually use this
âœ… Impressive demo: Live data streams are visually engaging
